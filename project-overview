Overview
A brief glance at what to expect heading into this project and its solutions.

Topic
Our solution Trashocated utilises technologies available to us to assist in cleaning our streets whether it be in local towns or in large scale city scapes. Users of the solution will be able to locate any surrounding ‘Trashocated’ bins to help dispose of their recyclable items and doing so rewards users with an in-app currency (or points). Furthermore, volunteers can assist in picking up recyclable trash from other users from the ‘Trashocated’ bins to main recycling bins. 

This system then can allow users to spend their accumulated points to purchase items made from recyclable resources thus going full circle of the Trashocated system. By incentivising the act of recycling materials will motivate users to correctly dispose of their garbage. According to the ‘National Recycling Week’, 51% of garbage in Australia is actually recycled so with this solution in mind we hope to achieve a higher percentile of recyclable waste.

Motivation
Pollution not only gives a negative aesthetic to our surroundings that can could potentially lead to disease and other health hazards but it directly impacts wildlife, both animals and plants. A majority of technology is dedicated to making our lives easier in both work and recreation, however we believe that technology should be more focussed on the more significant problems within our world and pollution is an issue that we are attempting to tackle.

Landscape
In terms of recycling, there are various solutions such as E-Waste and TechCollect that utilise the direct recycling of technological components such as mobile phones and computing devices to dedicated bins for future removal which in comparison is a similar concept to what we propose here. Though with our project we are hoping to directly affect garbage around us to clean the streets for all animals and plants and for the greater aesthetic for our home.
