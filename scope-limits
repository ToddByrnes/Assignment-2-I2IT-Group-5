Scope & Limits
Development of this solution on surface level is quite expansive, there are many components to this project that need to come together to fulfil our goal. One component is to construct a mobile application for users so they can; locate dedicated ‘Trashocated’ bins and keep score of their current points from recycling. The development of this application is the crux for the success of this solution and without it enables the solution useless. 

The application would likely be built through XCode on Apple Mac computers utilising Swift programming language and on the other hand, the Android application would likely be constructed in Android Studio with Java programming language. It would require the usage of maps from Google Services to assist in location of bins and on top of this, a database would need to be applied within this system to hold user information on their account details including their names, passwords and ‘Trashocated Points’ tally. The mobile application is the most troubling section of the entire solution and would require vast amounts of app development knowledge in order to deliver this section of the project.

Furthermore, ‘Trashocated’ bins or recycling bins in general would need to be identified which could potentially involve local government to organise said locators for disposal bins. For proof of concept these bins would be simulated as physical bins would be difficult to set up initially. 

Another segment of the solution that would be difficult to showcase as proof of concept would be the items that users can purchase with their earned ‘Trashocated’ points. These items could range from mobile phone cases, furniture, handbags, tupperware containers and many more. These items would be difficult to show proof of concept in final presentation but in this is what we are attempting to provide for our solution.
